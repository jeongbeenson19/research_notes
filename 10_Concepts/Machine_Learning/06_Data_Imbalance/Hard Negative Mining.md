# Hard Negative Mining

---

This is a placeholder document for **Hard Negative Mining**.

**Hard Negative Mining** is a common strategy used in training machine learning models, especially for object detection and classification tasks where there is a significant imbalance between the number of positive and negative samples. The goal is to select the most "informative" negative samples during training.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The process of identifying hard negatives (i.e., negative samples that the model incorrectly classifies as positive with high confidence).
- How it differs from Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM).
- Its importance in reducing false positives and improving model performance.
