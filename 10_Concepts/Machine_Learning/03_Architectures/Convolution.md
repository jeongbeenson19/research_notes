# Convolution

---

This is a placeholder document for **Convolution**.

In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a **convolution** is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a small filter (or kernel) over an input (such as an image) to produce a feature map. The filter is a small matrix of weights, and the operation computes the dot product between the filter and the input at each position.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The key components: input, filter (kernel), and feature map.
- The concepts of stride and padding.
- How convolutions enable parameter sharing and translation invariance.
- The difference between 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutions.
