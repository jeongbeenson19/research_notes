# DCN (Deformable Convolutional Networks)

---

This is a placeholder document for **Deformable Convolutional Networks (DCN)**.

**Deformable Convolutional Networks** introduce a mechanism to augment the fixed geometric structure of standard convolutional networks. DCNs add 2D offsets to the regular grid sampling locations in the standard convolution, allowing the network to learn to deform the sampling grid based on the input features.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The limitations of the fixed receptive field in standard CNNs.
- How Deformable Convolution works by learning offsets.
- The concept of Deformable RoI Pooling, which adapts to object structure.
- The benefits for tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, especially for non-rigid objects.
