# Nearest Neighbor Interpolation

---

This is a placeholder document for **Nearest Neighbor Interpolation**.

**Nearest Neighbor Interpolation** is the simplest image scaling algorithm. It determines the value of a new pixel by using the value of the single nearest pixel from the original image.

You can add more content here explaining:
- How the nearest neighbor is found.
- Its advantages (e.g., very fast, preserves original color values).
- Its disadvantages (e.g., produces blocky, pixelated results, especially when scaling up significantly).
- Use cases where its speed is more important than quality.
