# Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)

---

This is a placeholder document for **Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)**.

**FCNs** are a type of neural network architecture where all layers are convolutional layers. They are particularly important for tasks that produce spatial outputs, such as semantic segmentation, because they can take an input of any size and produce a corresponding output map. This is achieved by replacing traditional fully-connected layers with 1x1 convolutions.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The difference between a standard CNN for classification and an FCN.
- The use of upsampling or deconvolutional layers to restore the spatial resolution of the output.
- The concept of "skip connections" to combine deep, semantic features with shallow, appearance features.
