# M2Det

---

This is a placeholder document for the **M2Det** (Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network for Object Detection) architecture.

**M2Det** is an object detection model that introduces a novel Multi-Level Feature Pyramid Network (MLFPN) to extract more representative features from the input image.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The key components of the MLFPN:
    - Thinned U-shape Modules (TUMs)
    - Feature Fusion Modules (FFMs)
- How M2Det improves upon other single-stage detectors like SSD.
- Its performance on standard benchmarks (e.g., COCO).
