# Cascade R-CNN

---

This is a placeholder document for the **Cascade R-CNN** architecture.

**Cascade R-CNN** is a multi-stage object detection architecture that improves accuracy by training a sequence of detectors with increasing IoU thresholds. This allows each stage to specialize on proposals of a certain quality.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The problem of "close false positives" and how Cascade R-CNN addresses it.
- The architecture, showing how multiple detector "heads" are cascaded.
- How the progressive increase in IoU thresholds during training refines predictions.
- Its performance improvements, especially for high-quality, precise localization.
