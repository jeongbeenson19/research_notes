# R-FCN (Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks)

---

This is a placeholder document for the **R-FCN** architecture.

**R-FCN** is an object detection model that aims to improve the speed of region-based detectors like Faster R-CNN by minimizing the amount of computation per region. It achieves this by using position-sensitive score maps.

You can add more content here explaining:
- The concept of Position-Sensitive Score Maps and Position-Sensitive RoI Pooling.
- How R-FCN avoids applying a costly per-region subnetwork.
- The trade-offs between accuracy and speed compared to Faster R-CNN and other detectors.
